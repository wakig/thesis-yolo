Goal: Make the COCO dataset directory similar to PASCAL's: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aladdinpersson/pascal-voc-yolo-works-with-albumentations

Steps:
- Download COCO dataset
- in the root directory, create 'images' folder and put all images there (train and test combined)
- create 'labels' folder and create text files with the same name as the images (train and test combined)
- each label file should contain the category number and the bounding box (PASCAL   format), separated by spaces
- create train.csv and test.csv in the root directory.
- the CSV files will contain two columns: one for the image filenames, and the other for the label filenames.
- can now run train.py on COCO dataset


TO DO:
- Get height and width of image.
- YOLO format = (category, x_center, y_center, width, height)
- scaled from 0 to 1
